## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
NA

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

Overall, I would say that the project went very smoothly because the instructions were very well laid out. Moreover, testing every step instead of debugging the whole thing at once definitely helped me catch any errors right away. But in a coding project, there is always one bug that takes more time than it should. In my case,  the bug was that when the computer played the hint, my buttons weren't lighting up, so I started looking at the button implementations in Html, which didn't seem to be the problem. So then I looked for the function implementation in the style.css tab and saw that I was missing the button. lit implementation, so I added it, and then it worked. In addition, adding another button was also a lot of fun, as I got a deeper understanding of the project itself. For example, I understood how the frequency is set and where the rhythm is coming from. To conclude, I would say that the project was a lot of fun, especially, because I could see my code in action after each step.


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

These are some of the questions I have after the pre-work:
-	How to make engaging websites that impress the users and help them fulfill their purpose of coming to my website?
-	I am also interested in learning about how social media websites work, and how they maintain their large database without bugs. 
-	How to add pictures, videos, and sounds to a website, and wherein a website is it a good idea to add them?
-	How to get access to domain names for individual websites, and how long does it generally take from the beginning of web development to a fully working             
    website?
-	What is different between app development and web development, and which is more suitable for what purposes?


4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

I would start by giving points and then storing the highest points of the player, which will motivate the player to play more often to beat the highest score. I also think that it will be fun making levels by adding more features like more buttons and faster tunes with different themed backgrounds, which will certainly make the game make more entertaining for the players. I also think shuffling the tune each time the game begins will make the game more random and unpredictable, which will further test the memory of the players. I also think that giving lives and adding themes will help the players stay motivated if they keep failing.
